          <p>I once created a cover letter in which I <a href="http://rambleon.org/2008/12/19/what-did-it-for-you/">told the story</a> of how my career was set in motion on a 80286 and a copy of 4DOS and a recursive delete command. Now I only put in my cover letter how I used to tell that story and how it's barely a step up from walking 5 miles to school uphill each way in the snow. Which of course is patently ridiculous. I'm from the piedmont of North Carolina. We only can walk uphill each way in a nice freezing drizzle.</p>
          <p>I've been doing some version of what I do for a living for over 19 years now. From desktop support in a building full of Macs (SEs to IIcxs) and VT100 terminals with RS-232 running to broom closets and down to the VAX – to Win32 programming and creating the first campus-wide Windows NT labs at NC State University – to guiding the development of one of the first "desktop cloud" computing lab projects in the nation – to building websites on Linux in Ruby on Rails, I've had a lot of experiences to guide me to what it is I enjoy the most.</p>
          <p>And that's to <em>learn by doing meaningful work</em>. Which should be just as well shortened to: <strong>Do. Learn.</strong></p>
          <p>Thousands of problems, large and small, that have given me the foundation to know what I don't know, the ongoing humility of knowing that what worked yesterday may not work today, and the confidence that there isn't anything I won't figure out. I love technology, but I love more what it enables in others.  I am passionate about education and about helping others use technology to connect and communicate.</p>
          <p>Much of my work is in the open: The code for my day job is at <a href="http://github.com/extension">http://github.com/extension</a>. A few of my own projects are at <a href="http://github.com/jasonadamyoung">http://github.com/jasonadamyoung</a>. Some of it is good, some of it is just embarrassing—all of it is part of a fanatical pursuit of solving problems.  I usually ramble around a bit at <a href="http://rambleon.org">http://rambleon.org</a>. Be sure to see <a href="http://rambleon.org/about">http://rambleon.org/about</a>. Have a question?
